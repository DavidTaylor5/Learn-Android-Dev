Overview - Learn Android Dev

I want to make an app which will help people thoroughly learn the fundamentals of Android App Development. Rather than multiple choice questions, answers will be either typed in or coded. 
I will use a system to determine if what a user typed in was correct. 
I will also want to create a server which can update content for the app without necessarily needing another google play release. 
When user syncs with the server, content will be updated locally. 

I also want to investigate creating a Kotor Server which can distribute content from my Linux Computer.

- Kotlin Knowledge
